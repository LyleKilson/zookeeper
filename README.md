# zookeeper
Here's the scenario: the local zoo has received funding to build a new online catalog, and they've asked you to create a web server for a front-end application they’re developing, called Zoo Keepr. This site’s data will be stored on the server you create. This will allow animal enthusiasts to access the data from different locations and browsers without needing to download it to their device.

In this module, you’ll create a web server using the Express.js framework and add it to a front-end application that the local zoo is developing, called Zoo Keepr. The site’s data will live on the server you build so that anyone can access it without having to download it. You’ll also deploy your application to Heroku, a cloud application platform that allows you to deploy applications with servers to a webpage.

This section contains a list of the tools you’ll use in this module. You don’t need to install them before you begin—you’ll do that during the lessons.

Here are the tools you’ll use in this module:

Express.js (Links to an external site.) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is considered the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

Insomnia Core (Links to an external site.) is a powerful REST API client that allows us to test APIs and make client-side server requests without having to use a browser.

NOTE
You'll use Insomnia Core to test your APIs, NOT Insomnia Designer.

Heroku (Links to an external site.) is a cloud application platform that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Unlike GitHub pages, which only allows you to deploy static sites with HTML pages, Heroku allows you to deploy a server.js file that will run the Node.js process. You’ll also use the Heroku CLI (Links to an external site.), which will help you deploy apps easily without leaving the command line.
